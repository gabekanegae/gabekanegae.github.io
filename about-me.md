Hey! I am **Gabriel Kanegae**, but you might know me as Gabe or Kane. I'm Brazilian, born in 2000, and am a big tech enthusiast. I enjoy reading (sci-fi, mainly), writing (like this!), playing videogames and chilling to music (pop/rock/alt/indie).

I recently finished my **B.Sc. in Computer Science** degree at **Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (ICMC/USP), Brazil**, looking to follow a career path I dreamed of since I was a kid. Professionally, my main interests revolve around **Software Engineering, Task Automation / Scripting, Computer Graphics, Computer Hardware and Education**. Over the last couple years at uni, I've done some pretty interesting things: here's my [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabekanegae) if you want to check some of them out!

In my free time, I sometimes cook up some cool projects over on my [**GitHub**](https://github.com/gabekanegae), and I will try to highlight a couple of them over here, as well as write about any cool events I participated or whatever else I find interesting.

You can also get in touch with me via [**e-mail**](mailto:gabekanegae@gmail.com).
